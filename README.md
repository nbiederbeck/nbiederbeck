### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Physicist.

In my last job, I was a researcher at [Fraunhofer IEG](https://www.ieg.fraunhofer.de/).

Before, I was a Solution Engineer at [d-fine GmbH](https://www.d-fine.com/).

During my PhD in Astroparticle Physics at TU Dortmund University,
I wrote a [thesis](http://dx.doi.org/10.17877/DE290R-24039)
on gamma rays measured by the
[Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO)](https://www.ctao.org/).
I [worked extensively](https://github.com/cta-observatory/ctapipe/commits/main/?author=nbiederbeck)
on [ctapipe](https://github.com/cta-observatory/ctapipe),
the low-level data processing pipeline software for CTAO.

I participate regularly in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) to strengthen my programming skills and learn about new programming languages. See my solutions for
[2024](https://github.com/nbiederbeck/aoc24),
[2022](https://github.com/nbiederbeck/Advent-Of-Code-2022),
[2021](https://github.com/nbiederbeck/Advent-Of-Code-2021),
[2020](https://github.com/nbiederbeck/aoc2020),
[2019](https://github.com/nbiederbeck/Advent-Of-Code).
